# Roblox Baldi's Basics Multiplayer Classic Recreation

This is a **Baldi's Basics Classic** mod that ports over most of the features found in the Roblox fan-game: "*Baldi's Basics Multiplayer Classic*". Such as Custom Entities, and SchoolHouse Designs!
This mod uses the **Simplified & Overhauled BBC decompile** made by SadColored & Catshee: (https://gamebanana.com/tools/18976)
